X-Team Rollup v Webpack v Parcel comparison!

# Build Tool Show Down

We'll build a simple React app that's got simple implementations of all the basics:
```
    1.  React Router v4
    2.  React Redux
    3.  React 16.2.x
```

The exact `package.json` dependencies for our build tools:

Shared `babel` dependencies:
```json
    "babel-loader": "=7.1.4",
    "babel-plugin-external-helpers": "=6.22.0",
    "babel-preset-env": "=1.6.1",
    "babel-preset-react": "=6.24.1",
    "babel-preset-stage-0": "=6.24.1"
```

`parcel` dependencies:
```json
    "parcel-bundler": "=1.7.1"
```

`rollup` dependencies:
```json
    "rollup": "=0.58.2",
    "rollup-plugin-babel": "=3.0.4",
    "rollup-plugin-uglify": "=3.0.0"
```

`webpack` dependencies:
```json
    "webpack": "=4.6.0",
    "webpack-cli": "=2.0.15"
```

Each build tool's configuration is seperated into independent directories!

# Battle of the Builds

We'll be comparing *build time* for `production` and `development`, support for `.scss`, and *bundle size*.

```bash
    $ npm run build-parcel
    $ npm run build-webpack
    $ npm run build-rollup
```

# Testing

All three testing libraries were tested and built on the following Dell 15 <a href="https://pilot.search.dell.com/laptops/xps">XPS</a> 2016 with specs:

```
    Intel Core i7-6700HQ Quad-Core (8 Logical Cores) at 2.60 GHz
    32 GB RAM
    Windows 10 Pro + Linux Subsystem and Cygwin
    NVIDIA 960M GPU
    256GB m2 PCIe SSD
    15.6" FHD Screen
```
