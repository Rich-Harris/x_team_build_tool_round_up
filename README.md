X-Team Rollup v Webpack v Parcel comparison!

# Build Tool Show Down

We'll build a simple React app that's got simple implementations of all the basics:
```
    1.  React Router v4
    2.  React Redux
    3.  React 16.2.x
```

The exact `package.json` dependencies for our build tools:
```json
    "parcel-bundler": "=1.7.1",
    "rollup": "=0.58.2",
    "webpack": "=4.6.0"
```

Each build tool's configuration is seperated into independent directories!

# Battle of the Builds

We'll be comparing *build time* for `production` and `development`, support for `.scss`, and *bundle size*.
